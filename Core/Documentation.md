## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

#### Requirements

- **PHP:** Version 8.0 or higher
- **MySQL:** Version 5.7 or higher
- **Composer:** Dependency management tool for PHP

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astcode-mvcframework.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd astcode-mvcframework
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies via Composer:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other configurations.
   ```env
   DB_DSN=mysql:host=localhost;dbname=ast_base_framework
   DB_USER=your_db_username
   DB_PASS=your_db_password
   ```
5. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   php Migrations.php
   ```
6. **Set Up Web Server:**
   - Ensure the `public/` directory is set as the document root.
   - For development purposes, you can use PHP's built-in server:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:8000 -t public
     ```
7. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Defining Routes

Routes are defined in the `public/index.php` file using the `Router` class.

```php:file:public/index.php
$app->router->get('/home', [SiteController::class, 'home']);
$app->router->post('/contact', [SiteController::class, 'contact']);
```

**Example:**

```php:file:public/index.php
$app->router->get('/about', [SiteController::class, 'about']);
$app->router->post('/submit-form', [FormController::class, 'submit']);
```

### 3. Creating Controllers

Controllers handle specific groups of actions and extend the base `Controller` class.

```php:file:Controllers/ExampleController.php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use App\Core\Controller;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return $this->render('example/index');
    }

    public function submit()
    {
        // Handle form submission
    }
}
```

### 4. Creating Models

Models represent data and business logic. They extend the base `Model` class and define attributes, validation rules, and interaction methods.

```php:file:Models/ExampleModel.php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Core\Model;

class ExampleModel extends Model
{
    public string $title = '';
    public string $description = '';

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => [self::RULE_REQUIRED],
            'description' => [self::RULE_REQUIRED]
        ];
    }

    public function save()
    {
        // Logic to save data to the database
    }
}
```

### 5. Creating Views

Views are PHP templates that render HTML content. They can extend layout templates for consistent design.

```php:file:Views/example/index.php
<?php /** @var $this \App\Core\View */ ?>
<h1><?= $this->title ?></h1>
<p>Welcome to the example page.</p>
```

### 6. Form Handling

Utilize the `Form` class to create and manage forms with built-in validation.

```php:file:Views/auth/register.php
<?php
use App\Core\Form\Form;

/** @var $model \App\Models\User */
?>
<?php $form = Form::begin('/register', 'post'); ?>
    <?= $form->field($model, 'firstname')->placeholder('Enter your First Name...'); ?>
    <?= $form->field($model, 'lastname')->placeholder('Enter your Last Name...'); ?>
    <?= $form->field($model, 'username')->placeholder('Choose a Username...'); ?>
    <?= $form->field($model, 'password')->passwordField()->placeholder('Enter your Password...'); ?>
<?php echo Form::end(); ?>
```

### 7. Authentication

The framework provides built-in authentication mechanisms.

- **Register:** Create new user accounts.
- **Login:** Authenticate existing users.
- **Logout:** End user sessions.
- **Profile:** Manage user profiles.

**Example Routes:**

```php:file:public/index.php
$app->router->get('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
$app->router->post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
```

### 8. Middleware

Implement middleware to handle request filtering, such as authentication checks or CSRF protection.

```php:file:Core/Middlewares/AuthMiddleware.php
<?php

namespace App\Core\Middlewares;

use App\Core\Application;
use App\Core\Controller;

class AuthMiddleware extends BaseMiddleware
{
    public function __construct(array $actions)
    {
        $this->actions = $actions;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        if (Application::isGuest()) {
            Application::$app->response->redirect('/login');
            exit;
        }
    }
}
```

**Registering Middleware in Controller:**

```php:file:Controllers/AuthController.php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use App\Core\Controller;
use App\Core\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware;

class AuthController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->registerMiddleware(new AuthMiddleware(['profile']));
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

  - **Token Validation:** Middleware validates the token on form submission to ensure authenticity.

### 6. Database Migrations

A custom migration system allows for version-controlled changes to the database schema.

#### Migration Classes (`migrations/`)

Each migration is a PHP class that defines `up()` and `down()` methods to apply and revert changes.

- **Example Migration:**
  
  ```php:file:migrations/m0002_add_password_column_to_users_table.php
  <?php

  class m0002_add_password_column_to_users_table
  {
      public function up()
      {
          $db = \App\Core\Application::$app->db;
          $SQL = "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN password VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL;";
          $db->pdo->exec($SQL);
      }

      public function down()
      {
          $db = \App\Core\Application::$app->db;
          $SQL = "ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN password;";
          $db->pdo->exec($SQL);
      }
  }
  ```

### 7. Security Best Practices

The framework incorporates several security measures to protect web applications:
